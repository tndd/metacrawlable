# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

MetaCrawlable is a **fully implemented adversarial web crawler testing environment** built with Next.js App Router and Docker. The project provides a complete testing platform with 4 core mock websites, integrated health checking, and containerized Playwright testing capabilities.

### Purpose - Focused 4-Site Architecture

The project provides specifications for **4 core mock websites** that efficiently cover the main anti-crawler challenges:

1. **StaticLand** (`/static`) - Baseline static HTML + semantic structure testing
2. **DynamicMaze** (`/dynamic`) - Server-side DOM randomization + partial sitemap discovery  
3. **ClientShadow** (`/client-only`) - JavaScript-only rendering + CSR content detection
4. **BotWarden** (`/anti-bot`) - User-Agent blocking + access control evasion

This **4-site design eliminates previous specification conflicts** while maintaining comprehensive crawler testing capabilities.

## Architecture Overview

### Documentation Structure

- `docs/overview.md` - Project goals and 4-site design rationale
- `docs/structure.md` - Next.js App Router implementation architecture  
- `docs/anti-crawler.md` - Streamlined anti-crawler mechanisms for 4 sites
- `docs/sitemap-robots.md` - Unified sitemap/robots.txt configuration (no conflicts)
- `docs/implementation-guide.md` - Complete implementation guide with code examples
- `docs/sites/` - Individual specifications for 4 core sites only

### Removed Complexity

**Previous 10-site issues resolved:**
- ❌ Conflicting robots.txt requirements → ✅ Single unified robots.txt
- ❌ Impossible sitemap matrix → ✅ Logical sitemap distribution  
- ❌ SessionStorage server-side contradiction → ✅ Pure server-side randomization
- ❌ External API dependencies → ✅ Self-contained implementations
- ❌ Infinite recursion impossibilities → ✅ Practical finite implementations

## Key Implementation Requirements

### Technology Stack

- **Next.js 14+ App Router** (NOT Pages Router)
- **TypeScript** recommended for type safety
- **React 18+** for Server Components support
- **No external API dependencies** (self-contained)

└── sitemap.xml/route.ts        # ⏳ Unified sitemap generation
```

### Implementation Status

✅ **COMPLETED (PHASE 1-2):**

- ✅ All 4 sites implemented with Next.js App Router patterns
- ✅ User-Agent detection via middleware.ts for `/anti-bot` paths
- ✅ DOM randomization using Server Components (Math.random())
- ✅ Complete health check system (`/api/health`, `/api/ready`)
- ✅ Docker multi-stage build with health monitoring
- ✅ Playwright test integration with Docker networking
- ✅ No external API dependencies or infinite recursion

🔄 **CURRENT CAPABILITIES:**

- **89 pages total**: StaticLand(37) + DynamicMaze(22) + ClientShadow(27) + BotWarden(3)
- **Docker health checks**: Automatic container health monitoring
- **Test automation**: Dockerized Playwright testing for all 4 sites
- **Network isolation**: Custom Docker network with service discovery

⏳ **PENDING (PHASE 3):**

- **Unified robots.txt/sitemap**: Route Handlers implementation
- **CI/CD integration**: GitHub Actions workflow

## Development Guidelines

### Documentation Authority

- **All 4 sites are mandatory** - streamlined but comprehensive
- **Follow implementation-guide.md exactly** - complete code examples provided
- **No assumptions or modifications** - specifications are implementation-ready
- **Page count requirements**: StaticLand(37) + DynamicMaze(22) + ClientShadow(27) + BotWarden(3) = 89 pages total

### Containerization Status
